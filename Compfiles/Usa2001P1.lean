# USA Mathematical Olympiad 2001, Problem 1

Each of eight boxes contains six balls.
Each ball has been colored with one of n colors, such that no two balls
in the same box are the same color, and no two colors occur together in
more than one box. Determine, with justification, the smallest integer n
for which this is possible.
