# International Mathematical Olympiad 1974, Problem 1

Three players $A, B$ and $C$ play the following game:

* On each of three cards an integer is written.
* These three numbers $p, q, r$ satisfy $0 < p < q < r$.
* The three cards are shuffled and one is dealt to each player.
* Each then receives the number of counters indicated by the card he holds.
* Then the cards are shuffled again; the counters remain with the players.

This process (shuffling, dealing, giving out counters) takes place
for at least two rounds. After the last round, $A$ has 20 counters in all,
$B$ has 10 and $C$ has 9. At the last round $B$ received $r$ counters.

Who received $q$ counters on the first round?

Translation of [this proof](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/1974_IMO_Problems/Problem_1).

We'll model the `game` as a function ℕ → (Fin 3 ≃ Fin 3), mapping round
numbers to bijections between player-indices and card-indices.

Then, for example, `![p,q,r] (game k 2)` is the number of counters won by
player `2` in round `k`.
